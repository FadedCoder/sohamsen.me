        <h3 class="section-title">Developer?</h3>
        <p>
            Hi World, I'm just another developer on the big, big internet with a few peculiarities:
            <ul>
                <li>I know quite a few languages, ranging from Python, JavaScript, PHP to Golang, Rust, C/C++, Java (and
                    derivatives like Kotlin) to Assembly to Minecraft Redstone Logic.</li>
                <li>Although I regularly use and specialize in (Golang|Python|C/C++|JS).</li>
                <li>I fell in love with RegEx, but my sanity stops me from using it everywhere. Yet.</li>
                <li>For fun, I code. Yes, money too, but fun foremost. I quite enjoy programming.</li>
                <li>I'll post the stuff I've done someday. One day. Meanwhile, if you wan't a résumé,
                    <a href="mailto:contact@sohamsen.me" class="link">please send an email!</a></li>
            </ul>
            Maybe I'll write about programming in my blog. Maybe not. It's just there are so many programming blogs, it
            seems redundant.

        <h3 class="section-title">Amateur &lt;insert word&gt;?</h3>
        <p>
            People have hobbies. I like to call myself an amateur when it comes to my hobbies. I'll definitely be
            writing in my blog about these hobbies.
            <ul>
                <li>I love receiving and transmitting radio waves. Like listening to weather satellites transmitting a
                    picture. Or creating my own LTE basestation.</li>
                <li>Tinkering with electronics is yet another hobby of mine. Rather, this hobby gave birth to my radio
                    hobby.</li>
                <li>Did I say how much I love the deep space? My childhood wish was/is to become an astronaut. Sadly,
                    I'm just a student and not old enough to specialize in astronomy, so I can only be an amateur now.
                </li>
                <li>Oh, and I also own a 8" F/6 Dobsonian Telescope, I'll try to post some astropics too. Sadly, where I
                    live, the light and air pollution is unforgiving</li>
                <li>If the katakana version of my name was not enough, let me write it: I am a weeb/otaku/anime-lover.
                    No, I don't own waifu dakimakuras. Yes I love anime/manga/VNs/LNs.</li>
            </ul>

        This website was made without CSS frameworks, without gigabytes of content and just a tiny bit of optional
        JS.<br>
        So yes, it should run on a DSL connection and will also load on esoteric/hipster browsers like mothra, links,
        lynx, or eww.<br>
        Not that I can understand why people would use that or have a DSL connection in &lt;insert&nbsp;year&gt;.<br><br>
