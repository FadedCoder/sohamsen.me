        <h3 class="section-title">Developer?</h3>
        <p>
            Hello World, I'm just another developer on the big, big internet with a few peculiarities:
        <ul>
            <li>I know quite a few languages, ranging from Python, JavaScript, PHP to Golang, Rust, C/C++, Java (and
                derivatives like Kotlin) to Assembly to Minecraft Redstone Logic.</li>
            <li>Although I regularly use and specialize in (Golang|Python|C/C++|PHP).</li>
            <li>For fun, I code. Yes, money too, but fun foremost. I quite enjoy programming.</li>
            <li>Due to privacy concerns I'm a bit hesitant to put my CV online. If you want a résumé,
                <a href="mailto:contact@sohamsen.me" class="link">please send an email!</a></li>
            <li>Not strictly relevant, but I love participating in CTFs (TL;DR hacking competitions)! One day, I wish to
                participate in DEFCON :D</li>
            <li>I LOVE managing servers! I own some dedicated servers to play around and learn networking and stuff. As
                you can guess, I mostly self host everything, including this site</li>
        </ul>
        Maybe I'll write about programming in my <a href="https://blog.sohamsen.me/" class="link">blog</a>. Maybe not.
        It's just there are so many programming blogs, it
        seems redundant.

        <h3 class="section-title">I wanna know more!</h3>
        <p>
            People have hobbies. I have them too, though a bit different from "normal" ones. I'll definitely be
            writing in my <a href="https://blog.sohamsen.me/" class="link">blog</a> about these hobbies.
        <ul>
            <li>I love receiving and transmitting radio waves. Like listening to weather satellites transmitting a
                picture. Or creating my own LTE basestation.</li>
            <li>Tinkering with electronics is yet another hobby of mine. Rather, this hobby gave birth to my radio
                hobby.</li>
            <li>Did I say how much I love the deep space? My childhood wish was/is to become an astronaut. Sadly,
                I'm just a student and not old enough to specialize in astronomy, so I can only be an amateur now. Every
                now and then, I try to participate in astronomy competitions.
            </li>
            <li>Oh, and I also own a 8" F/6 Dobsonian Telescope, I'll try to post some astropics too. Sadly, where I
                live, the light and air pollution is unforgiving</li>
            <li>If the katakana version of my name was not enough, let me write it: I am a weeb/otaku/anime-lover.
                No, I don't own waifu dakimakuras. Yes I love anime/manga/VNs/LNs.</li>
        </ul>

        This website was made without CSS frameworks, without gigabytes of content and just a tiny bit of optional
        JS.<br>
        So yes, it should run on a DSL connection and will also load on esoteric/hipster browsers like mothra, links,
        lynx, or eww.<br>
        Not that I can understand why people would use that or have a DSL connection in
        &lt;insert&nbsp;year&gt;.<br><br>
